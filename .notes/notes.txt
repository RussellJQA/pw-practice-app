This project was cloned to my PC using:

    D:
    cd D:\dev\_ts\testguild     
    git clone https://github.com/bondar-artem/pw-practice-app
        // This pw-practice-app is a:
            // modified and more lightweight version of original application to practice UI Automation with Playwright
            //  at htps://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin
        // Both applications are MIT-licensed

Then, within the resulting D:\dev\_ts\testguild\pw-practice-app folder, I needed to do:

    npm init playwright@latest --force

And start the pw-practice-app running on http://localhost:4200, by typing (in the Terminal):

    npm start

and waiting for the following output to appear:

    ** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **
